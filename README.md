# Grid-based-Tactics-Template

This is a simple template to create turn-based tactics games such as XCOM or Pixel Soldiers in Godot. Started as just
a fun side project to get more used to AStar pathfinding and creating grids for games in general, will likely
be used to create some of my games in the future.
